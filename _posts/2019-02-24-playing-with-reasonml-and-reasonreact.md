This days I've decided to take a look at the [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/) language. This is a very nice functional programming language developped by Facebook and based on OCaml.

A good way to play with this language is to try [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/), the Reason version of React.
You can find a small example I did [here](https://repl.it/@Loic_D/reasonReactLearn-List) (basically a CRUD).

As you can see, there is a lot of nice things for a Scala developer, like pattern matching or the Option type.
