I've just published minimal demo application to show how to build a purely functional web application in Scala.  
To learn more about the benefits of this approach, you can read the Readme file.
I've used Typelevel libraries to build this application : http4s, Doobie, CatsEffect and Circe.

You can find the project here : https://github.com/loicdescotte/pureWebappSample
