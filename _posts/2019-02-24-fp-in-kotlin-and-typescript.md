After an [introduction to functional programming and error management in Scala](https://lab.kaizen-solutions.net/2019/01/14/introduction-a-la-gestion-derreur-en-programmation-fonctionnelle-partie-1-scala/), I've written [a post on my company's blog](https://lab.kaizen-solutions.net/2019/01/16/introduction-a-la-gestion-derreurs-en-programmation-fonctionnelle-partie-2-kotlin-et-typescript/) about Arrow (a Kotlin FP library) and fp-ts(a TypeScript FP library).
This posts are both written in french language. I hope it can help to let people start using FP in mainstream languages :)
