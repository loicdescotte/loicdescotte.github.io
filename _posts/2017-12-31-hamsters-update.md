The end of 2017 has been quite busy for the Hamsters team! 

In November, I went to the awesome ScalaIO conference and had the chance to do a talk about [Hamsters](https://github.com/scala-hamsters/hamsters) with Damien Gouyette (also a member of the Hamsters team).
You can see the video here (in french) : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SaD28-1ds4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SaD28-1ds4).  

The last day of the conference, several persons have made great contributions to the library during an OSS workshop organized by the [Scala center](https://scala.epfl.ch/), and we've been able to release the 2.0 version just after that.  

A week ago, 2.4.0 has been released with a new feature, [mapN](https://github.com/scala-hamsters/hamsters/blob/master/docs/mapN.md).
