I've just published Scala hamsters first stable version. It's a simple Scala utility library featuring Lists, Union types, Monad transformers and Validation.  
Hamsters is fully compatible with functional programming beginners!  

It may help you understand how to use - and how to implement (looking at the code) - some popular functional programming features. Il also provides some useful utilities.

You can find it here : [https://github.com/loicdescotte/hamsters](https://github.com/loicdescotte/hamsters)
